                <br>
                <h3>ü•ó What Is a Balanced Diet?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>A balanced diet provides your body with the right mix of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water to function at its best. In Nigeria, this doesn‚Äôt mean fancy or foreign food. It means combining our rich local ingredients in the right proportions.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>üåü Why Is a Balanced Diet Important?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>1. Boosts Energy: Foods like yam, rice, and unripe plantain give you the energy to power through your day.</p>
                <p>2. Supports Growth and Repair Proteins from beans, eggs, fish (like Titus or catfish), and moi moi help build strong muscles and repair tissues.</p>
                <p>3. Strengthens Immunity: Ugu (pumpkin leaves), oranges, and pawpaw are packed with vitamins that help your body fight off sickness.</p>
                <p>4. Prevents Chronic Illness: Eating more vegetables, whole grains like acha (fonio), and healthy oils like palm oil (in moderation) can reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease.</p>
                <p>5. Improves Mental Focus: A good mix of nutrients helps you stay sharp‚Äîgreat for students, workers, and elders alike.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>üçõ What Should Be on a Plate?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>1. Half your plate: Vegetables and fruits like okra, ugu, carrots, garden eggs, and mangoes.</p>
                <p>2. One-quarter: Whole grains or starchy foods like brown rice, amala, fufu, or ofada rice.</p>
                <p>3. One-quarter: Lean proteins like beans, moi moi, grilled fish, or chicken.</p>
                <p>4. Plus: A small portion of healthy fats (groundnuts, avocado, or palm oil) and plenty of water.</p>

                <h2>Meal Planning</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>üçΩÔ∏è What Is Meal Planning?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Meal planning is the simple act of deciding in advance what you‚Äôll eat for your meals and snacks‚Äîwhether for a day, a week, or longer. It involves choosing recipes, making a shopping list, and sometimes prepping ingredients ahead of time. Think of it as a roadmap to better eating, less stress, and smarter choices.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>üåü Why Is Meal Planning Important?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>1. Promotes Healthier Eating: When you plan ahead, you're more likely to include a variety of nutritious foods‚Äîlike fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins‚Äîrather than grabbing fast food or skipping meals.</p>
                <p>2. Saves Time and Reduces Stress: No more last-minute ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù panic. With a plan in place, you spend less time deciding and more time enjoying your meals.</p>
                <p>3. Helps You Stick to a Budget: Planning meals means fewer impulse buys and less food waste. You buy only what you need and use it wisely.</p>
                <p>4. Supports Portion Control: Pre-planned meals help you avoid overeating and make it easier to manage your portions and calorie intake.</p>
                <p>5. Encourages Variety and Balance You can rotate ingredients, explore new recipes, and ensure your meals are balanced across the week.</p>
