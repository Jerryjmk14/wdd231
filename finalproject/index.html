                <h2>Quick Nutrition Tips</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drink water before meals – It helps control appetite and aids digestion. Sometimes, what feels like hunger is actually thirst.</li>
                    
                    <li>Go for color – A vibrant plate usually means a variety of nutrients. Aim for at least 3 different colors in every meal from fruits and vegetables.</li>
                    
                    <li>Read labels – Watch for hidden sugars and sodium in packaged foods, even in items marketed as "healthy."</li>
                    
                    <li>Choose whole over refined – Swap white rice for brown rice or unpolished local grains like fonio or millet for added fiber and nutrients.</li>
                    
                    <li>Don’t skip meals – Especially breakfast. It jump-starts your metabolism and helps with concentration and energy throughout the day.</li>
                    
                </ul>

                <h2>Overview of essential nutrients</h2>
                <br>
                <p>🥦 1. Carbohydrates: Your body’s main energy source. Found in foods like rice, bread, fruits, and vegetables. Choose complex carbs (like whole grains) for longer-lasting energy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>🍗 2. Proteins: The building blocks for muscles, skin, and organs. They help repair tissues and support growth. Sources include meat, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>🥑 3. Fats: Essential for brain health, hormone production, and absorbing vitamins. Healthy fats come from avocados, nuts, seeds, and oils like olive or palm oil (in moderation).</p>
                <br>
                <p>💧 4. Water: Often overlooked, but vital! It regulates body temperature, transports nutrients, and flushes out toxins. Aim to drink plenty throughout the day.</p>
                <br>
                <p>🍊 5. Vitamins: Micronutrients that support immunity, vision, skin health, and more. Each vitamin has a unique role—like Vitamin C for healing and Vitamin D for bones.</p>
                <br>
                <p>🧂 6. Minerals: Help with everything from strong bones (calcium) to oxygen transport (iron). Found in leafy greens, dairy, meats, and whole grains.</p>
